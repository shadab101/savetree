      Bengaluru: Plans to develop a proposed six-lane flyover between
      Basaveshwara Circle and Hebbal in Karnataka's state capital have run into
      trouble following stiff opposition by local residents and city-based
      activists. With an estimated cost of Rs 2,400 crore, construction of the
      6.72 km long road began with the objective of cutting down the travel time
      of motorists and de-congesting the streets of Bengaluru. Proposed by
      Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), the idea was to build an elevated
      flyover along the roads leading to the city's international airport in
      Devanahalli area. However, following a spate of citywide protests, the
      project was scrapped. A report suggesting that the project would cost Rs
      1,800 crore and would also result in the felling of close to 800 trees led
      to the outcry.
