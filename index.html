            longer be available. Trees helps to clean the air, soil and water,
            making the earth a beautiful livable place. Living close to trees

            <strong> 1. Saving Trees Around You </strong><br />
            Every town and city has laws which tree species need to be protected
            and when and how it’s OK to cut down trees. In some areas, trees
            that are delicate, rare or extremely beneficial are protected by
            law. Knowing the laws in your area will help you be a better
            advocate for the trees there.

            <strong>2. What you can do to save the Tree</strong><br />
            Speak up to save the tree, rather than just letting it get cut down.
            Get together with other people who care about saving trees in your
            area and make it clear that you object to cutting down healthy
            trees. Even if there’s no law against cutting down the tree, if
            enough people think trees are important and need to be protected,
            you might be able to create change. Even if it’s too late for this
            particular tree, you’ll set a precedent for next time. Here are a
            few things you can do: • Write a letter of objection to your city
            forester or city council member. • Start a petition to change
            policies or protect certain trees. Rally neighbors to get involved
            in saving the neighborhood trees. • Get the media involved by
            sending a letter to the editor or contacting a local TV station
